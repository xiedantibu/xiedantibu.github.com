This article will discuss the IDE known as <a href="../../../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dev-c">Dev-C++</a> (specifically, Bloodshed Dev-C++), which is in surprisingly common usage. More specifically, I will be discussing why we try to steer people away from using Dev-C++, and <a href="#Fixes"><b>what you can do</b></a> if you are a Dev-C++ user. This article does not apply to Orwell Dev-C++ or any other forks of Dev-C++ (Orwell Dev-C++ will be discussed below as a viable alternative).<br>
<br>
<div class="center"><h3>Why we've deprecated Dev-C++</h3></div>
<br>
It all boils down to one reason:<br>
<i><b><u>The official Dev-C++ hasn't been updated since 2005</u></b></i>, and likely will never be updated since <i>the lead developer has stated in 2006 that due to personal issues he will not be continuing development on Dev-C++</i>.<br>
<br>
From there, there are 3 main problems that are directly caused by Dev-C++'s age.<br>
<ol>
<li>The included MinGW is obsolete.<br>
<li>The many known bugs may never be fixed.<br>
<li>The IDE lacks the features of more modern IDEs.</ol>
I'll go over each of these in order.<br>
<br>
<div class="center"><h4>The included MinGW is obsolete.</h4></div>
MinGW is an irregular acronym which stands for "<b>Min</b>imalist <b>G</b>NU for <b>W</b>indows". It includes a various set of tools commonly found on many *nixes including the g++ compiler and gdb debugger, which Dev-C++ makes use of.<br>
<br>
A problem with Dev-C++ not being updated in computer centuries is that the bundled MinGW is several years old, and as a result the compiler doesn't work nearly as well on new systems as a hot-out-of-the-oven copy of MinGW's g++ would. The latest version of Dev-C++ comes with MinGW version 3.4.2, however at the time of this article's last update (November 8, 2013) MinGW's g++ is at version 4.8.1.<br>
<br>
Finally, not only is the code generation likely worse with an older compiler, but the compiler bundled with Dev-C++ was released well before the C++11 standard started to gain steam. Many valuable C++11 features (like auto, decltype, the new for loop syntax, lambdas, regexes, and multithreading) are completely unsupported.<br>
<br>
<div class="center"><h4>The many known bugs may never be fixed.</h4></div>
The latest version of Dev-C++ (4.9.9.2, which by the way is a beta) currently has over 350 open bugs according to Sourceforge's bug tracker (<a href="../../../sourceforge.net/p/dev-cpp/bugs/search/q!status_253awont-fix!status_253aclosed">link</a>), and possibly more that are not accounted for.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, due to the fact that the dev-packs system is no longer being updated, that feature itself has also become broken with many packs being either outdated or no longer existent.<br>
<br>
Since the lead developer quit and there have been no updates since then, it is highly unlikely that these bugs will ever be fixed.<br>
<br>
<div class="center"><h4>The IDE lacks many of the features of more modern IDEs.</h4></div>
Dev-C++'s debugging utilities are... also old. A debugger is an essential utility for any programmer to have at any level, and complaints about the Dev-C++ debugging interface being confusing are not uncommon.<br>
<br>
In addition, the code completion and file parsers are lagging behind the times as well. As the C++11 standard has now been released, most of the fully-featured IDEs have added support for C++11 features. Dev-C++, however, will likely not change, making it even less suitable for programming in C++ than it is now.<br>
<br>
<a name="Fixes"></a><div class="center"><h3>What you can do if you're using Dev-C++</h3></div>
<div class="center"><h4>Switch to Orwell Dev-C++</h4></div>
This is a recommended option if you really like Dev-C++ or if you're required to use it. It's a fork of the original Dev-C++ that is more up-to-date with C++11 support. It offers a choice between two modern compilers, one for 32-bit platforms and one for 64-bit platforms.<br>
<br>
You can download Orwell Dev-C++ with either compiler here: <a href="../../../sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/files/setup%20releases/default.htm">http://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/files/Setup%20Releases/</a>
<br>
<div class="center"><h4>Completely switch IDEs</h4></div>
There are other IDEs in existence, some of which are of excellent quality. Although changing IDEs has a learning curve, there are some formidable alternatives to Dev-C++ in existence. All of the IDEs listed here will run on Windows, though not all of them come bundled with compilers.<br>
<br>
The list of good free IDEs includes but is not limited to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio C++ Express -&gt; <a href="../../../www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2013-express">http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2013-express</a>
<ul><li>Includes a compiler.<br>
</ul>
<li>QT Creator -&gt; <a href="../../../qt-project.org/downloads">http://qt-project.org/downloads</a> (scroll down a bit to download it as a standalone)<br>
<ul><li>Provides excellent support for developing using the Qt framework.<br>
</ul>
<li>Netbeans -&gt; <a href="../../../netbeans.org/downloads/default.htm">http://netbeans.org/downloads/</a>
<ul><li>Requires Java.<br>
</ul>
<li>Eclipse (CDT) -&gt; <a href="../../../www.eclipse.org/cdt/downloads.php">http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/downloads.php</a>
<ul><li>Requires Java.<br>
<li>Can be a bit intimidating for newer users.<br>
</ul>
<li>Code::Blocks -&gt; <a href="../../../www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26">http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26</a>
<ul><li>Includes a compiler.</ul>
</ul>
<div class="center"><h4>Go minimalist</h4></div>
This isn't an option I recommend too highly for most, however using a minimalist text editor with makefiles and a terminal is something I sometimes enjoy as a development option, and I'm sure there are others who would as well.<br>
<br>
Possible lightweight editors include but are not limited to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Programmer's Notepad -&gt; <a href="../../../www.pnotepad.org/download/default.htm">http://www.pnotepad.org/download/</a>
<li>Geany -&gt; <a href="../../../www.geany.org/download/releases#windowsBinaries">http://www.geany.org/Download/Releases#windowsBinaries</a>
<li>Nano -&gt; <a href="../../../www.nano-editor.org/download.php">http://www.nano-editor.org/download.php</a>
<li>Vim -&gt; <a href="../../../www.vim.org/download.php">http://www.vim.org/download.php</a>
<li>Emacs -&gt; <a href="../../../www.gnu.org/software/emacs#Obtaining">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Obtaining</a>
<li>Notepad++ -&gt; <a href="../../../notepad-plus-plus.org/download">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download</a></ul>
<br>
<div class="center"><h4>Update Dev-C++</h4></div>
I recommend this option the least considering the problems you might run into with the IDE itself, however if you're highly reluctant to change to even Orwell Dev-C++ then the least one can do to make the IDE more suitable for use is update the included MinGW.<br>
<br>
I cannot give the specifics of how to do this, unfortunately, as I am incapable of even installing Dev-C++. However, you would probably end up doing a few searches for MinGW-related files, removing them, and the installing the new MinGW in their places. <b>Be careful doing this, though, as having two versions of MinGW might trigger linker errors ("undefined reference to __cpu_features_init").</b>
<br>
<br>
<div class="center"><h3>In conclusion...</h3></div>
<br>
While the original Dev-C++ might be easy to use, that does not mean that you should stick with it. To quote Moschops from <a href="../../../cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/43898/default.htm#msg237572">here</a>: <blockquote>Nailing my feet to the floor is easier than using my own muscles to balance, but you don't see me doing that :)</blockquote>

EDIT1: Added some useful hyperlinks.<br>
EDIT2: Fixed the bullet points.<br>
EDIT3: Put the pluses back in the article after an encoding update erased them. Also updated the wxDev-C++ download link.<br>
EDIT4: Added QT Creator and Notepad++. Thank you <b>Danellos</b> and <b>immutable</b> for the suggestions!<br>
EDIT5: I just *had* to include a quite by <b>Moschops</b> at the end. :)<br>
EDIT6: Fixed a small formatting issue, added a few links, and made some other small changes.<br>
EDIT7: Updated the Eclipse CDT link to reflect a new version and made a few phrasing changes.<br>
EDIT8: Acknowledged that Orwell Dev-C++ is a very worthy alternative.<br>
EDIT9: Updated the Sourceforge bug tracker link, and made some small wording changes.<br>
EDIT10: Updated a few links, emphasized the point about this referring to Bloodshed Dev-C++, and removed the recommendation to switch to wxDev-C++ as its development has been stagnant for some time now.<br>
EDIT11: Removed a note that Code::Blocks is dated, as there was a release on 2013-12-27.</div></div><div id="CH_bb"></div><div id="CH_scoreapp"></div><script type="text/javascript">new Score('CH_scoreapp','../score.cgi','36vU7k9E');</script></div>
